# Mission Statement
We are an online community for Catholic developers, technologists, and visual media artists. Our mission is to use our gifts and talents for one common goal: the greater glory of God. With our shared faith, interests, hobbies, and talents, we wish to act as a platform for collaboration, feedback, networking, and community projects.

# Community Projects
St. Paul says that we must “become all things to all men, that (we) might save all” (1 Corinthians 9:22). This is the digital era, yet many churches lack modern designed, functional, informational websites. Our goal of community projects is to support our local Parishes, non-profits, Knights of Columbus councils, etc. with their online presence.

# Patron: Saint Isidore of Seville
Isidore (560-636) was a spanish scholar and cleric. He served as Archbishop of Seville for 30+ years until his death in 636. He is widely regarded, in the words of 19th-century historian Montalembert, as "the last scholar of the ancient world".

He was canonized a saint of the Roman Catholic Church in 1598, and is also recognized as a Saint in the Eastern Orthodox church. His feast is April 4th. In 1997 Pope Saint John Paul IIII proposed him as the patron saint of computers and their users, programmers, repair people, as well as the internet as a whole.* (though it was never officially declared).

He is regarded as the patron saint of Computer Users because of his most important work: the Etymologiae. This was an organized compilation of all knowledge from the time. Its title was taken from the method he used in the transcription of his era's knowledge and was similar to a dictionary. This method gave his work a structure similar to that of the database
